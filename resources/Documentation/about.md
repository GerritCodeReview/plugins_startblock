The @PLUGIN@ plugin provides support for enabling submit requirements
managed by the startblock bot. This plugin must be used with the bot.
TODO: Implement the bot.

If the @PLUGIN@ plugin is enabled, changes can only be submitted if
the change doesn't have the hashtag "BLOCK_SUBMISSION", which may
be added by the bot from time to time.
